## Vision & Strategy

### What We're Building

**PRIMARY:** EstateSaleFinder.org - Estate Sale Marketplace Platform
**SECONDARY:** ListingAI - AI-powered listing automation (dogfooded through estate sales, then extracted as standalone SaaS)

**The Dogfooding Strategy:**
1. Build estate sale marketplace with AI listing creator built-in
2. Estate sale companies love the AI feature (saves them hours)
3. Extract AI listing feature as standalone product (ListingAI)
4. Sell ListingAI to broader market (eBay sellers, Etsy sellers, thrift stores)
5. Two revenue streams: Marketplace fees + SaaS subscriptions

**Three User Types (EstateSaleFinder.org):**
1. **Buyers** - Discover sales, bid on items, find treasures
2. **Individual Sellers** - List collectibles, run auctions, build shops
3. **Estate Sale Companies** - Manage events, list inventory, get analytics (become ListingAI customers)

**Business Model:**
- Freemium subscriptions ($9-29/mo for sellers)
- Transaction fees (5-10% commission on sales)
- Premium features (analytics, featured placement, white-label)

**Competitive Positioning:**

| Site | Monthly Visits | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| estatesales.net | 7.1M | 2000s UX, no AI | Modern UX, AI-first |
| estatesales.org | 950K | Clunky, high fees | Lower fees, better mobile |
| eBay | 1B+ | Generic, 13% fees | Specialized, 5-10% fees |

## Growth Strategy

### Traffic Acquisition (Solve Chicken-Egg Problem)

**Phase 1: Aggregation (Instant Inventory)**
- Scrape estatesales.org, estatesales.net, estatesale-finder.com
- Launch with 10K+ listings on Day 1
- Always attribute + link back (drive them traffic)
- **Why this works:** Buyers come for content, sellers see traffic

**Phase 2: SEO (Long-Term Traffic)**
- Target keywords: "estate sales near me" (90K/mo searches)
- City pages: "estate sales Portland" × 1000 cities
- Blog: "How to price estate sale items", "Best estate sale finds"
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months to rank #1

**Phase 3: Paid Ads (Fast Validation)**
- Google Ads: "sell antiques online", "list estate sale"
- Facebook: Target estate sale professionals, vintage dealers
- Budget: $1K-3K/month for first 90 days
- **Goal:** $20-50 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

**Phase 4: Partnerships (Credibility)**
- Estate sale companies (white-label offering)

- Auction houses (integration partners)
- **Goal:** 10-20 partnerships by Month 6

**Phase 5: Community (Viral Loop)**

- Craigslist ads: "Sell your collectibles online"

- In-person: Visit Portland antique shops

**Tier 2: Local Partnerships (Next 40 sellers)**
- Partner with estate sale companies (white-label)
- Antique shops (consignment deals)
- Flea market vendors (weekend sellers)
- **Pitch:** Free for 6 months, 5% fees after (vs. eBay's 13%)

**Tier 3: Paid Acquisition (Next 50 sellers)**
- Google/Facebook ads targeting sellers
- Content marketing (SEO blog posts)
- YouTube: "How to sell collectibles online"
- **CAC target:** $20-50 per seller

**Retention Strategy:**

- Month 1: $10K
- Month 3: $50K

- Month 12: $1M

### Key Metrics (90-Day Goals)

**Sellers:**
- Total sellers: 100
- Active sellers (listed ≥1 item in 30 days): 70
- Retention (month-over-month): 70%
- Avg items per seller: 5
- Avg revenue per seller: $500/month

**Buyers:**

- Repeat buyers: 40%

**Transactions:**

**Platform:**
- Monthly GMV: $50K

### Product-Market Fit Indicators

**Strong PMF signals:**
- ✅ 70%+ seller retention month-over-month
- ✅ 40%+ organic growth (referrals, word-of-mouth)
- ✅ Sellers asking "When can I upgrade to Pro?"
- ✅ Buyers checking daily for new items
- ✅ GMV doubling every 2-3 months

**Weak PMF signals:**
- ❌ Sellers list 1-2 items then churn
- ❌ Low transaction volume (<50/month)
- ❌ All growth is paid (no organic)
- ❌ Negative reviews, complaints
- ❌ GMV flat or declining

**If strong PMF by Month 6 → Raise funding or scale bootstrap**
**If weak PMF by Month 6 → Pivot or shut down**

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Can't Get First 100 Sellers (60% probability)

**Mitigation:**
- Start with aggregation (instant inventory)
- Offer free Pro for 6 months (remove friction)
- Manual outreach (10 sellers personally onboarded)
- Local-first (Portland → Seattle → SF)
- Lower bar: Accept 50 sellers as "good enough" to continue

**Kill criteria:** If <50 sellers by Day 90 → Shut down

### Risk 2: Traffic Acquisition Too Expensive

**Mitigation:**
- SEO (free, long-term)
- Scraping = free inventory (sellers come for traffic)
- Partnerships (estate sale companies drive traffic)
- Content marketing (blog, YouTube)
- Target CAC: <$50/seller (if higher, pause paid ads)

### Risk 3: ChatGPT/AI Disruption

**Mitigation:**
- Build transaction layer (ChatGPT can't process payments)
- Community features (shops, followers, reviews)
- Proprietary data (exclusive seller listings)
- Become infrastructure (ChatGPT links TO us)
- Move fast (6-12 month window before AI gets good)

### Risk 4: Regulatory/Legal (Scraping, Payments)

**Mitigation:**
- Robots.txt compliance
- Attribution + deep linking (drive competitors traffic)
- DMCA policy (takedown on request)
- Stripe Connect (handles compliance)
- Legal review before launch

### Risk 5: Founder Burnout

**Mitigation:**
- 90-day validation checkpoints (assess, don't grind forever)
- Set kill criteria upfront (no emotional decisions)
- Focus on one metric (100 sellers)
- Celebrate small wins
- If not working by Month 6 → Move on
