# EstateSaleFinder.ai - Development Roadmap

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Phase 1: Refactoring & Foundation
- [x] Complete Sale ‚Üí Listing terminology refactoring
- [x] Database schema updates (sale_type ‚Üí event_type, sale_hours ‚Üí event_hours)
- [x] All table renames (sale_images ‚Üí listing_images, etc.)
- [x] Repository & Service layer renames
- [x] Integration tests passing (12/12 tests)
- [x] Backend compiles successfully
- [x] API working with Docker Compose stack

## üéØ Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

### Phase 2: Fix & Polish
1. ~~**Fix Scraper Integration Test Failures**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
   - ~~Issue: Expecting 9 listings but getting 4~~
   - ~~Need to investigate PostgreSQL data persistence~~
   - **Resolution**: Tests were hardcoding expectations. The scraper correctly persists all 9 listings across multiple cities in the Portland metro area (Portland, Beaverton, Gresham, etc.). Modified tests to dynamically verify that scraped count matches database count and understand that `GetListingsByLocation("Portland", "OR")` returns only listings with city="Portland", not all metro area listings.
   - All 6 scraper integration tests now passing ‚úÖ

2. **Update Frontend to Use New API Structure**
   - Update frontend types to match backend (event_type, event_hours)
   - Verify frontend still works with refactored backend

3. **Environment Setup Documentation**
   - Update GETTING_STARTED.md with current structure
   - Document Docker setup vs local setup
